<h2 id="HTML">What is HTML</h2>
<p>
    This is a short introduction to writing HTML. What is HTML? It is a special kind of text document that is used by
    Web browsers to present text and graphics. The text includes markup tags such as
<p> to indicate the start of a paragraph, and </p> to indicate the end of a paragraph. HTML documents are often refered
to as "Web pages". The browser retrieves Web pages from Web servers that thanks to the Internet, can be pretty much
anywhere in World.

Many people still write HTML by hand using tools such as NotePad on Windows, or TextEdit on the Mac. This guide will get
you up and running. Even if you don't intend to edit HTML directly and instead plan to use an HTML editor such as
Netscape Composer, or W3C's Amaya, this guide will enable you to understand enough to make better use of such tools and
how to make your HTML documents accessible on a wide range of browsers. Once you are comfortable with the basics of
authoring HTML, you may want to learn how to add a touch of style using CSS, and to go on to try out features covered in
my page on advanced HTML

p.s. a good way to learn is to look at how other people have coded their html pages. To do this, click on the "View"
menu and then on "Source". On some browsers, you instead need to click on the "File" menu and then on "View Source". Try
it with this page to see how I have applied the ideas I explain below. You will find yourself developing a critical eye
as many pages look rather a mess under the hood!

For Mac users, before you can save a file with the ".html" extension, you will need to ensure that your document is
formatted as plain text. For TextEdit, you can set this with the "Format" menu's "Make Plain Text" option.

This page will teach you how to:<br>

start with a title<br>
add headings and paragraphs<br>
add emphasis to your text<br>
add images<br>
add links to other pages<br>
use various kinds of lists<br>
If you are looking for something else, try the advanced HTML page.<br>

<h2 id="OGNL">Apache Commons OGNL - Object Graph Navigation Library</h2>
<p>OGNL stands for Object-Graph Navigation Language; it is an expression language for getting and setting properties of
    Java objects, plus other extras such as list projection and selection and lambda expressions. You use the same
    expression for both getting and setting the value of a property.

    The Ognl class contains convenience methods for evaluating OGNL expressions. You can do this in two stages, parsing
    an expression into an internal form and then using that internal form to either set or get the value of a property;
    or you can do it in a single stage, and get or set a property using the String form of the expression directly.

    OGNL started out as a way to set up associations between UI components and controllers using property names. As the
    desire for more complicated associations grew, Drew Davidson created what he called KVCL, for Key-Value Coding
    Language, egged on by Luke Blanshard. Luke then reimplemented the language using ANTLR, came up with the new name,
    and, egged on by Drew, filled it out to its current state. Later on Luke again reimplemented the language using
    JavaCC. Further maintenance on all the code is done by Drew (with spiritual guidance from Luke).

    We pronounce OGNL as a word, like the last syllables of a drunken pronunciation of "orthogonal".</p>

<h2 id="spring-data-jpa">Spring data jpa - core concepts</h2>
<p>The central interface in Spring Data repository abstraction is Repository (probably not that much of a surprise).
    It takes the domain class to manage as well as the id type of the domain class as type arguments.
    This interface acts primarily as a marker interface to capture the types to work with and to help you
    to discover interfaces that extend this one. The CrudRepository provides sophisticated CRUD functionality for the
    entity class that is being managed.</p>
